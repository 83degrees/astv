# ASTV Project Governance

This generated payload is self-contained for the central Governance rules
rendered into it. Read every more-specific applicable nested `AGENTS.md` for the
actual work scope; nested instructions may add stricter controls but must not
silently weaken applicable central rules.

<!-- BEGIN GOVERNANCE SOURCE: 00_Governance/core/governance.md -->
## Shared governance

Read every applicable `AGENTS.md` before work. A nested file may add stricter
rules but must not silently weaken project-wide safety, architecture, contract,
or authorization controls.

Before changing anything:

1. identify the approved scope and exact files;
2. inspect the applicable sources of truth;
3. identify affected product owners, interfaces, and consumers;
4. expose conflicts, missing evidence, and material ambiguity instead of
   guessing; and
5. define proportionate validation.

User-authored edits are authoritative unless explicitly superseded. Make the
smallest scoped change. Do not opportunistically reformat, relayout, rename,
move, or refactor unrelated material.

Changes to component ownership, subsystem boundaries, inputs or outputs,
routing, external dependencies, or interface meaning are architecture or
contract changes and require explicit approval.

Chat history and historical handovers preserve context but are not the sole
durable record. Promote approved decisions to current architecture, contracts,
governance sources, or Linear as appropriate.

A task is complete only when implementation is in scope, relevant validation
passes, evidence and limitations are recorded, and no unrelated files or system
state changed.

For Git-managed product files, commit history is the technical change history
and diff is the normal comparison. Do not duplicate it with revision logs,
source backups, or equivalent recovery copies. Governed baselines, evidence,
contracts, CR records, and DDRs serve distinct purposes. Linear remains the sole
product work tracker; apply the Git capability only to repositories actually
changed.

## Governance change requests

When a governance rule appears missing, incorrect, incomplete, or unsuitable,
do not treat a generated `AGENTS.md` as authoritative or edit it directly. Pause
only the affected unsafe or ambiguous work when necessary, record and link a
Governance CR, and follow
`00_Governance/docs/GOVERNANCE_CHANGE_REQUESTS.md`. A temporary restriction may
narrow or pause authority; it must never grant new authority.
<!-- END GOVERNANCE SOURCE: 00_Governance/core/governance.md -->

<!-- BEGIN GOVERNANCE SOURCE: 00_Governance/core/source-of-truth.md -->
## Source of truth

When sources disagree, use this precedence:

1. current production evidence;
2. current explicit interface contracts;
3. current subsystem architecture documentation and authoritative diagrams;
4. applicable generated governance instructions;
5. project documentation and current-state summaries;
6. historical or pre-project context;
7. temporary working notes and chat history.

A Linear issue is the approved work instruction, not a source of technical
truth. If its scope or acceptance criteria conflict with a higher-precedence
source, stop and record the conflict rather than silently resolving it.

A copied production snapshot is read-only evidence and is authoritative only as
of its recorded capture. Check provenance, timestamp, completeness, exclusions,
and integrity hashes before relying on it. Prefer verified read-only live
evidence when freshness matters and access is authorized.

Current, approved target, proposed, exploratory, historical, and unresolved
states must be labelled distinctly. Never describe a proposed design as current
production behavior.

Subject authority refines, but does not replace, the precedence above:

- production evidence establishes what is actually deployed;
- explicit contracts define precise interfaces;
- the approved product `*_ARCHITECTURE.md` is the semantic architecture record;
- the approved product `*_ARCHITECTURE.drawio` is the visual structure and
  layout record;
- applicable generated governance instructions define agent and governance
  rules in their scope; and
- Git records tracked repository state and technical change history.

For each Git-managed product repository, `main` is the current integrated state
accepted into `main` under the governed workflow. Presence on `main` alone does
not prove final validation, Linear `Done`, or deployed production state.

## Governance model: controlled-implementation 1.0.0

Implementation is controlled by a hard pickup gate. It cannot begin unless:

1. an eligible `ASTV-...` Linear identifier exists on the shared `astv` team;
2. a separate Codex implementation task has retrieved the full issue;
3. the issue is in `Ready`;
4. scope and acceptance criteria have been checked against the source-of-truth
   hierarchy;
5. no conflict or material ambiguity remains; and
6. that Codex task has moved the issue from `Ready` to `In Progress`.

Creating, refining, approving, or moving an issue to `Ready` in a design task
never authorizes that same task to implement it. Without a valid pickup, limit
work to discussion, read-only investigation, and work-instruction preparation.

After pickup, Codex owns scoped implementation and validation. Before moving the
issue to `Review / Test`, record changed files, validation, results, and unresolved
limitations. Only the user may move it to `Done`.

An explicitly populated and user-activated `CURRENT_WORK.md` is exceptional. If
it conflicts with the Linear instruction, stop and ask which one controls.

<!-- BEGIN GOVERNANCE SOURCE: 00_Governance/models/controlled-production/1.0.0.md -->
## Governance model: controlled-production 1.0.0

All `controlled-implementation` pickup and completion rules apply.

In addition:

- production evidence must be mounted or granted read-only for routine work;
- live Home Assistant access must default to read-only outside an issue whose
  approved scope explicitly requires mutation;
- mutation tools must be enabled only for that separately governed task;
- never deploy, reload, restart, call services, or alter live state unless the
  work instruction explicitly authorizes it; and
- validate locally and statically before any controlled runtime step.

Repository instructions are policy, not a mechanical security boundary. If the
environment exposes broader write capabilities, do not use them outside a valid
pickup and explicitly authorized scope.

<!-- BEGIN GOVERNANCE SOURCE: 00_Governance/capabilities/contracts/1.1.0.md -->
## Contract capability 1.1.0

Cross-product interfaces are explicit contracts. A consumer must not depend on
another product's undocumented internals. Authoritative shared contracts live
once under `contracts/`; do not copy them into product repositories or create
parallel contract authorities.

Do not rename, add, remove, normalize, reinterpret, or change the requiredness of
fields without reviewing the authoritative contract and every known producer and
consumer. A caller capture-variable name and a child return-field name are
different concepts and must not be made identical merely for consistency.

If a boundary change is required:

1. identify ownership and all known producers and consumers;
2. update the shared contract first or as one coordinated change;
3. keep each product's implementation work separately authorized; and
4. validate compatibility and failure behavior.

Use the central contract registry to record ownership, producers, consumers,
status, version, and relative source path. Architecture may explain a boundary,
but the contract remains authoritative for its precise interface. A
contract-affecting issue cannot reach `Done` until the authoritative shared
contract is current. Product Git gates apply independently only to product
repositories actually changed; changing only shared contract material does not
create an artificial product-repository commit or push.

<!-- BEGIN GOVERNANCE SOURCE: 00_Governance/capabilities/linear-workflow/1.1.0.md -->
## Linear workflow capability 1.1.0

Linear is the sole product work tracker and work-control record. GitHub Issues
must not be introduced as a parallel ASTV, AdvMedia, or MediaCat backlog. All
three products use the shared Linear team `astv` and the intentional shared
`ASTV-...` issue namespace.

Durable roles are separate:

- **Design task:** discusses requirements, inspects evidence read-only, develops
  design, and prepares or refines the work instruction. It stops after handing
  back the issue identifier.
- **Approved Linear work instruction:** carries scope, acceptance criteria,
  dependencies, and required validation. It does not override technical sources
  of truth.
- **Separate implementation task:** retrieves the issue, satisfies the selected
  model's pickup gate, implements only the approved scope, validates it, and
  records evidence.

Use the shared status meanings:

- `Ready`: approved and eligible for pickup where the model permits.
- `In Progress`: picked up by the implementation task.
- `Review / Test`: implementation and Codex validation complete; ready for user
  review or testing.
- `Done`: final user acceptance only.

Conversational phrases such as “agreed”, “continue”, “go ahead”, or “approved”
approve design or work definition only. They never bypass the Linear boundary.

When product repositories change, `Done` also requires every affected
repository's committed-`main`, validation, evidence, and push gate. A required
DDR adds its gate. Shared-only work gains no artificial product Git gate. Commit
and DDR references add traceability without replacing Linear.

<!-- BEGIN GOVERNANCE SOURCE: 00_Governance/capabilities/production-evidence/1.1.0.md -->
## Production evidence capability 1.1.0

Production evidence is held outside product repositories under
`Production_ReadOnly/` and must remain read-only. Never modify, rename, delete,
reformat, regenerate, copy it into a product repository, or use it as a working
directory. Never sync local changes back to production.

Before relying on evidence, check its capture timestamp, source, procedure,
included and excluded areas, freshness, and hashes. If evidence is missing,
stale, incomplete, or ambiguous, say so and do not invent behavior. A missing
capture manifest is a limitation to fix in a future capture process, not by
retrospectively editing an existing snapshot.

Governance stores only metadata, SHA-256 hashes, relative references, and compact
validation notes. Credentials, secrets, mutable state, production snapshots, and
large rollback payloads remain outside future version-controlled governance.

Use the production-capture manifest and evidence-index schemas for new captures.
Record exactly what was inspected, what was verified, what remains unverified,
and whether authorized live read-only evidence supplemented the snapshot.

Production evidence, Git state, and validation evidence are distinct.
Validation evidence remains outside individual product repositories and records
the governing Linear issue plus every affected repository and committed SHA.
Final validation must address the committed result; pre-commit checks are not a
substitute. A push proves only remote presence, not validation, approval,
completion, or deployed production state.
<!-- END GOVERNANCE SOURCE: 00_Governance/capabilities/production-evidence/1.1.0.md -->

<!-- BEGIN GOVERNANCE SOURCE: 00_Governance/capabilities/git-workflow/1.0.0.md -->
## Git workflow capability 1.0.0

Git commit history is the authoritative technical change history for ASTV,
AdvMedia, and MediaCat repository files; Git diff is the normal comparison.
`main` is the integrated state accepted under the governed workflow, not proof
of final validation, Linear `Done`, or deployment.

Do not create per-file change logs, before/after copies, dated backups, `.old`,
`.bak`, `.backup`, copied source baselines, or equivalent artefacts whose sole
purpose duplicates Git history. Governance baselines, evidence, contracts, CR
records, and DDRs are distinct exceptions.

Apply this gate independently to every affected product repository. Its
authoritative `main` commit should normally reference the Linear issue; where a
DDR applies it must reference both IDs. Do not split one issue merely because it
affects several repositories.

Use direct work on `main` when there is no meaningful approval gap:

1. edit on `main` and perform pre-commit diff, syntax, and static checks;
2. commit the scoped result to `main`;
3. perform final governed validation against that committed SHA;
4. record validation evidence outside the product repository, identifying the
   repository, SHA, and governing Linear issue; and
5. push the successfully validated `main` commit to the configured remote.

When work precedes merge acceptance, use a temporary branch containing the issue
ID. Preserve commits and use a merge commit, which is the authoritative
traceability commit. Then validate, evidence, and push the resulting `main` SHA.

Linear `Done` is prohibited until every affected product repository and every
other applicable completion gate passes. Repositories may use different
workflow styles. Push does not prove validation, approval, completion, or
deployment.

Delete a temporary branch only after merge, validation, push, and overall issue
completion. Mandatory pull requests, tags, and branch protection are not
introduced. Work that changes no Git-managed product repository follows existing
controls without an artificial SHA or push.

<!-- BEGIN GOVERNANCE SOURCE: 00_Governance/capabilities/ddr/1.0.0.md -->
## DDR capability 1.0.0

A DDR is required only for a significant design decision whose rationale must
outlive immediate Linear and implementation history: material boundary,
interface, architectural-alternative, constraint, dependency, routing,
cross-product, capability, or approved-architecture departure decisions. Routine
implementation, refactoring, bug fixes, wording, diagram layout, and recording
an already-approved design do not normally require one.

If a future maintainer could reasonably ask why this approach was chosen over a
plausible alternative, preserve the answer. Do not create DDRs automatically or
retroactively merely because the capability exists.

Use the approved template at
`01_Governance_Stabilisation/03_DDRs/DDR_Template.md`. There is one global
sequence: `DDR-001`, `DDR-002`, and so on. Filenames contain only the identifier,
for example `DDR-004.md`. Product-specific DDRs normally live under
`<Product>/00_Decisions/`; cross-product DDRs temporarily live in the approved
Governance Stabilisation DDR area.

The registry at `01_Governance_Stabilisation/03_DDRs/DDR_Registry.xlsx` contains
exactly `DDR Number` and `Authoritative File Location`. Reserve the next number
before creating the DDR with location `RESERVED`; never reuse it. Abandoned
reservations become `ABANDONED`. A moved DDR keeps its number and changes only
its location.

Where required, exactly one DDR maps to exactly one Linear issue and conversely;
most issues need none. Split independent significant decisions, not a single
decision affecting several repositories. The Linear issue ID is mandatory.

Every DDR has a mandatory `Supersedes` field containing either the previous DDR
number or `None`. Do not modify an approved DDR to add `Superseded By`. A later
decision uses a new DDR whose `Supersedes` field references the earlier record.

A DDR is editable while its issue is in progress. `Done` requires the completed
record at its registered path, mandatory issue and supersession fields, and its
applicable committed product state. Reserved, abandoned, missing, incomplete, or
applicable uncommitted DDRs fail the gate. It becomes immutable only after
validation, affected-repository Git gates, and Linear `Done`.

## ASTV product overlay

ASTV is the Home Assistant intent and orchestration product. It owns NFC/tag
entry, request resolution, intent routing, household area/domain preference,
endpoint and playback-method selection, fallback order, and dispatch to the
appropriate execution path.

Read `ASTV/01_Architecture/ASTV_ARCHITECTURE.md` and the applicable contracts.
`ASTV/00_PreProject_History/CONTEXT_HANDOVER.md` is retained historical context
only. Legacy or unused scripts are not current architecture merely because they
remain in configuration.

ASTV may call AdvMedia through `contracts/ASTV_ADVMEDIA_INTERFACE.md`, but must
not expand or depend on AdvMedia internals. Preserve exact interface and response
names across gateways, engines, adapters, providers, and return boundaries.

ASTV production evidence is read-only. No available filesystem or Home Assistant
write capability may be used without an explicitly authorized ASTV issue.
